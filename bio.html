<p style="color:black;" align= left> In Fall 2016, I returned to my alma mater as a faculty member in the <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu" id="link">Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley</a>. Previously, I was a <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program" id="link">Hubble Fellow</a> at the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/astron/" id="link">University of Washington</a>. I spent the first year of my Hubble Fellowship (2013-2014) at <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu" id="link">UC Santa Cruz</a> working with <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home" id="link">Charlie Conroy</a> before moving back to Washington for the remaining two years of my fellowship (2014-2016). Prior to being awarded a Hubble Fellowship, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washingtion working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jdal/Julianne_Dalcanton/Home.html" id="link">Julianne Dalcanton</a> on the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/astron/" id="link">Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury</a> (PHAT) program, one of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" id="link">Hubble Space Telescope (HST) </a> programs in history.

In 2010, I received a PhD in Astrophysics from the <a href="http://www.astro.umn.edu" id="link">University of Minnesota</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~skillman/" id="link">Evan Skillman</a>. My thesis work used HST to trace patterns of star formation in dozens of nearby dwarf galaxies back in time to their formation in the early Universe. Prior to my PhD, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I received a double degree in Physics and Astrophysics in 2004.

I am a proud product of public schools from elementary school through my PhD. In 2000, I graduated from <a href="https://southwest.mpls.k12.mn.us" id="link">Minneapolis Southwest High School</a> an <a href="http://www.ibo.org" id="link">International Baccalaureate Diploma</a>. For middle school, I attended the pre-IB program at <a href="http://anwatin.mpls.k12.mn.us" id="link">Anwatin Middle School</a>. I was fortunate to have attended an outstanding and very unusual elementary school: <a href="http://dowling.mpls.k12.mn.us" id="link">Dowling Urban Environmental Learning Center</a>. 
        <br> <br>
    
Outside of Astronomy, I have spent most of my life around soccer fields. Starting at age 3, I played for various park and club teams around the Twin Cities. In college, I played for the UC Berkeley Men's Club Team, and later for the <a href="https://umnclubsoccer.wixsite.com/umnmenssoccer" id="link">University of Minnesota Men's Club Team</a>, reaching the <a href="http://play.nirsa.net/soccer/" id="link">NIRSA national club tournament</a> with both schools. I also played for several high-level amateur teams, including Blackhawks of the <a href="http://www.masl.org" id="link">Minnesota Amateur Soccer League</a> and Minnesota NSC United of the semi-professional National Premier Soccer League. 
         <br> <br>
    
I am also a high-level soccer coach who has worked with very competitive girls' and womens' teams. I coached club soccer with the <a href="http://www.mnthunderacademy.org" id="link">Minnesota Thunder Academy</a> (formerly Bangu FC), where I prepared youth players for the transition to the collegiate level. Most players I coached went on to play collegiate soccer, and several players were selected to represent the U.S. at various youth international levels. I also spent a couple of seasons working with the U.S. Youth Soccer <a href="https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/olympic-development-program/" id="link">Olympic Development Program</a>, and I hold <a href="https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/" id="link">National 'D'</a> coaching license from the <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com" id="link">United States Soccer Federation</a>. 
           <br> <br>
  
In addition to club coaching, I was also an assistant coach at the high school and collegiate levels with womens' teams at the <a href="http://www.academyofholyangels.org" id="link">Academy of Holy Angels High School</a>, the <a href="http://www.tommiesports.com/sports/wsoc/index" id="link">University of St. Thomas</a>, and <a href="http://www.goslugs.com/sports/wsoc/index" id="link">UC Santa Cruz</a>. Highlights from these programs include the success of the St. Thomas teams, which made multiple NCAA national tournament appearances, won a <a href="http://www.miacathletics.com" id="link">Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> championship, and completed an <a href="http://www.tommiesports.com/sports/wsoc/2008-09/releases/11-01-2008-womens-soccer-wins-31-are-miac-champs-alone.html" id="link">undefeated regular season in 2008</a>. </p>
