<p style="color:black;" align= left> <bold> Near-field Cosmology </bold> - The history of our Universe is imprinted in the stars and galaxies that live in our local neighborhood.  The number counts, spatial distributions, and internal properties of galaxies in our Local Group and its surroundings are linked to structure formation (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ARA%26A..55..343B/abstract" id="link">dark matter and galaxy assembly</a>) and physical processes (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ARA%26A..53..631F/abstract" id="link">reionization, explosions of the first generations of stars</a>) that shaped the early Universe.  I am interested in crystalizing connections between the very local and very early Universe and in developing innovative approaches to linking observations of the local and distant Universe. My interests in near-field cosmology are described in this <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51c...1W/abstract" id="link">white paper</a>. 
  
<p style="color:black;" align= left> <bold> Galaxies </bold> - I am interested in the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.  I use powerful telescopes such as <a href="https://hubblesite.org/" id="link">Hubble</a> and <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/" id="link"> Keck</a> to resolve individual stars in a wide-range of galaxies, from the faintest galaxies in the Universe to famous massive galaxies.  I dissect galaxies on a star-by-star basis to understand their history of star formation, dust content, and the relationship between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium.  I have been centrally involved in some of the largest Hubble surveys of nearby galaxies including <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/angst/" id="link">ANGST</a>, <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/angrrr/" id="link">ANGRRR</a>, <a href="https://hubblesite.org/images/gallery/73-phat" id="link">PHAT</a> and the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/image/4305" id="link">Legacy Survey of the Triangulum</a>. I am particularly interested in the Andromeda galaxy system and am Principle Investigator of the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019hst..prop15902W/abstract" id="link">250 orbit Cycle 27 Hubble Program</a> that will uncover the entire formation history of all of M31â€™s satellites. </p>
              
<p style="color:black;" align= left> <bold> Stars </bold> - We are in a golden age of stellar astrophysics. A wealth of new data in the Milky Way (e.g.,<i>Gaia</i>) has placed stellar astrophysics at the forefront of many astrophysics disciplines, from a detailed understanding of microphysics to measuring the expansion history of the Universe. One area of interest is the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...806..198W/abstract" id="link">high-mass stellar initial mass function</a>, which is central to interpreting the light of any star-forming galaxy in the Universe, but remains poorly measured.  I am also interested in very metal-poor stars (< 10% of the Solar abundance).  Massive metal-poor stars were the engines that shaped galaxies in the early Universe while the chemical abundance patterns of low-mass metal-poor stars encode the enrichment history of the Universe.  My group makes use of advanced statistical techniques to model the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468..319E/abstract" id="link">initial mass function</a> and interpret the spectra of stars. </p> 
  
<p style="color:black;" align= left> <bold> James Webb Space Telescope </bold> - Slated for launch in 2021, the <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov" id="link">James Webb Space Telescope</a> (JWST) is the most ambitious and most powerful telescope ever built.  I am principle investigator of the Resolved Stellar Populations <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/observing-programs/approved-ers-programs" id="link">Early Release Science Program</a> for JWST.  My team will be among the first to use JWST to acquire images of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017jwst.prop.1334W/abstract" id="link">nearby galaxies and star clusters</a> We will build the technical infrastructure needed for the nearby galaxy community to use JWST and we will pioneer JWST for studies of the local Universe. </p>
